## Overview
This repository contains code for three machine learning tasks completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The projects cover various aspects of data science, including classification, analysis, and prediction.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
The Iris Flower Classification task involves training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The model learns from the measurements of the iris species and predicts their classes.

### 2. Unemployment Analysis with Python
Unemployment Analysis focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate, which is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the total labor force. The project aims to understand trends in unemployment, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.

### 3. Sales Prediction Using Python
Sales Prediction involves predicting the sales of a product based on various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience, and advertising platform. The goal is to help businesses make informed decisions about their marketing strategies.
